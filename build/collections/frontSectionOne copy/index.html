<p>He’s changing careers. He went back to school. He’s getting braces (no joke).</p>
<p>His online presence is a little all over the place.</p>
<p>As his website, sometimes it can be difficult for me to keep up. Is he a translator? Is he a web developer? It’s not always clear.
Like any website, I like a clear brand. But I’m a personal website. We’re a little different. Personal websites have to embrace the messiness. And, really, I think we’re better for it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m excited for Walter. An awkward phase means the start of something new. Change is good for all of us. I’m looking forward to what comes next. I just hope he doesn’t forget about me.</p>
